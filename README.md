# 2019 Princeton Computational Bootcamp

Organized by [Princeton Research Computing](https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing).

**See** [**website**](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PUbootcamp2019) **for more details**

**Where**: Princeton University, 138 Lewis Library
**When**: October 28 - 30, 2019

This three-day bootcamp will introduce some foundational topics, tools, and techniques that underpin modern computational research.  In a series of hands-on workshops, participants will be exposed to some common computing workflows: the command-line; navigating a computing cluster; good practices in software engineering and data visualization; version control; leveraging Python's numerical and scientific packages.  The goal is to get participants conversant with these fundamental skills, both because they are immediately useful and because they furnish a basis for learning more advanced tools and techniques later on.

The bootcamp will consist of a series of short sessions (see agenda), each focused on a different topic. Almost all sessions will include hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material presented.  Since some people will already have sufficient background in certain topics, participants will be able to register a-la carte for only the individual sessions they need.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided daily.

**Registration**: Open to all members of the Princeton community.  Seating is limited, so advance registration is required.   **Although attending the entire bootcamp is recommended, participants will have the option to register for just the individual sessions that they would like to attend.**

**Requirements**: Because the sessions are hands-on, **participants should bring their own laptops and power supplies each day**. Prior to the bootcamp, all participants should **obtain an account on the Adroit cluster** ([register here](forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/?q=adroit)) and **have an ssh client and X server installed and *tested* on their laptops prior to the bootcamp** ([MacOSX, Windows, and Linux instructions](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PUbootcamp/ssh-instructions)).

**Prerequisites**: Prerequisites vary from session to session. Some require no prior experience. Others assume material presented earlier in the bootcamp. Still others require at least some prior exposure to Linux and/or Python. More information about a session's prerequisites can be found in that session's description on the bootcamp website.
