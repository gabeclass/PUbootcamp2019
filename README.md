# 2019 Princeton Computational Bootcamp

Organized by [Princeton Research Computing](https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing).

**See** [**website**](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PUbootcamp2019) **for more details**

**Where**: Princeton University, 138 Lewis Library
**When**: October 28 - 30, 2019

This three-day bootcamp will introduce some foundational topics, tools, and techniques upon which modern computational research builds.  In a series of hands-on workshops, participants will be exposed to some common computing workflows: the command-line, navigating a computing cluster, good practices in software engineering and data visualization, version control, and leveraging Python's numerical and scientific packages.  The goal is to get participants conversant with these fundamental skills, both because they are immediately useful and because they furnish a basis for learning more advanced tools and techniques later on.

The bootcamp will consist of a series of short sessions (see agenda), each focused on a different topic. Almost all sessions will include hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material presented.  Registration is required, but since some people will already have sufficient background in certain topics, participants will be able to register a-la carte for only the individual sessions they need.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided daily.

**Registration**: Open to all members of the Princeton community.  Seating is limited, so advance registration is required.   **While attending the entire bootcamp is recommended, participants will be able to register "a la carte" for the individual sessions that they would like to attend.**

**Requirements**: Because of the hands on nature of the sessions, **participants should bring their own laptops and power supplies each day**. Prior to the bootcamp, all participants should **obtain an account on the Adroit cluster** ([register here](forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/?q=adroit)) and **have an ssh client and Xserver installed and *tested* on their laptops prior to the bootcamp** ([MacOSX, Windows, and Linux instructions](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PUbootcamp/ssh-instructions)).

**Prerequisites**: Prerequisite vary from session to session. Some require no prior experience, while others require at least a bit of prior exposure to Linux and/or Python. For information about the prerequisites for each session, consult their descriptions on the bootcamp website.
