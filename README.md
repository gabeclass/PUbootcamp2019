# 2019 Princeton Computational Bootcamp

Organized by [Princeton Research Computing](https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing).

**See** [**website**](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PUbootcamp2019) **for more details**

**Where**: Princeton University, 138 Lewis Library
**When**: October 28 - 30, 2019

This three-day bootcamp will provide an introduction to a variety of topics, tools, and techniques that form the foundation of skills and knowledge upon which modern computational research builds.  In a series of hands-on workshops, participants will be exposed to aspects of common computing workflows: the command-line, navigating a computing cluster, good practices in software engineering and data visualization, version control, and leveraging Python's numerical and scientific packages.  The goal is to get participants conversant with these fundamental skills, not only because they are immediately useful but also because they empower researchers to learn more advanced tools and techniques.

The bootcamp will consists of a series of short sessions (see agenda), each focused on a different topic. Almost all sessions will include hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material presented.  Registration is required, but since some people will already have sufficient background in certain topics, participants will be able to register a-la carte for only the individual sessions they need.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided daily.

**Registration**: Open to all members of the Princeton community.  Seating is limited so advanced registration is required.   **Attending the entire bootcamp is recommended, but participants may register "a la carte" for each individual session they would like to attend.**

**Requirements**: Because of the hands on nature of the sessions, **each participant should bring a laptop and power supply each day**. Prior to the bootcamp, all participants should **obtain an account on the Adroit cluster** ([register here](forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/?q=adroit)) and **have an ssh client and Xserver installed and *tested* on their laptops prior to the bootcamp** ([MacOSX, Windows, and Linux instructions](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PUbootcamp/ssh-instructions)).

**Prerequisites**: Most sessions require no prior experience with Linux or programming, but some require at least a bit of prior exposure to Linux or Python. More information about prerequisites can be found in the description for each session on the bootcamp website.
