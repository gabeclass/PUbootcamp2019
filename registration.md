Registration is now closed. For those that are unable to attend this time, we do hope to be able to offer the bootcamp again soon.

Please register using [this form](https://forms.gle/1GuAnsrQLEnnsAa19).

[Registration](https://forms.gle/1GuAnsrQLEnnsAa19) is open to all current Princeton University researchers, students, or staff.  Seating is extremely limited, and we expect to run out of space.  Participants can choose which sessions to attend, but **advance registration is required.**
<!--
If you are unable to attend the entire bootcamp, but would still like to attend a portion of it, please email us at [rcinfo@princeton.edu](mailto:rcinfo@princeton.edu) with your availability and we will add you to the wait list. If seats are available we will do the best we can to accommodate as many participants as possible.
-->


We hope that this will become an annual or semi-annual event. With sufficient interest, we will likely be able to continue to offer it. If for any reason you cannot attend the bootcamp but would like to express your interest in a future bootcamp, or if you have suggestions for topics to add to (or remove from) future bootcamps, please email us at [rcinfo@princeton.edu](mailto:rcinfo@princeton.edu).
