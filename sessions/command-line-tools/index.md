## Description ##
This session will introduce regular expressions and Linux command line tools, with an emphasis on the GNU flavored inflections of such common utilities as grep, find, sed, awk, and other stand-bys of BASH pipelines and scripts. In a mixture of lecture, demos, and hands-on activities, participants will see various ways to expedite many day-to-day computing tasks, particularly tasks that involves handling structured text files (including data files and parameter files).

## Learning objectives ##
Participants will learn ways to improve their command-line workflow, how to read and compose regular expressions, how to use command-line tools that leverage regular expressions, and how to chain those tools together to create powerful file-processing pipelines. They will also leave with enough know-how to parse and understand the plethora of online resources that offer tips and tricks for these tools. infor further learning and be armed with enough conceptual understanding of how Linux works “under the hood” to make sense of those resources.

## Knowledge prerequisites ##
Basic Linux and the Bash command-line (covered in the earlier "Intro to the Linux Command Line" session)

## Hardware/software prerequisites ##
Participants must have access to a Linux/Unix command line. Some of the material covered will not work quite the same way by default for Mac users using the versions of command-line utilites that come by default with macOS.  Mac users are strongly encouraged to install the GNU version of those utilities using a package manager, such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  Attendees without a Linux/Unix command line on their laptops can still participate in the session by connecting to [Adroit](https://forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/).

## Session format
