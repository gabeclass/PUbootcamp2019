## Description
This workshop will introduce participants to the Linux filesystem and the Linux command line (specifically the bash shell). It will demonstrate how to navigate the filesystem, work with files using common Linux text utilities, and run programs, and it will cover more advanced concepts such as streams, pipelines, file permissions, and environment variables. Participants will also learn how to connect to remote machines (like the Princeton clusters) via SSH. Most of the workshop material translates to the command line on MacOS or other Unix systems (exceptions will be noted). This workshop presumes no prior knowledge of computer programming or of Linux/Unix.

## Learning objectives
Attendees will learn how to navigate the Linux filesystem and run basic commands and how to connect to Princeton computing systems from their own laptops via SSH. They will also leave with resources for further learning and be armed with enough conceptual understanding of how Linux works “under the hood” to make sense of those resources.

## Knowledge prerequisites
None

## Hardware/software prerequisites
1.Bring a laptop which can connect to the eduroam wireless network. You will also need to be able to Duo authenticate to use campus resources.
2.Register for an account on Adroit. This is the cluster we will use for demonstration purposes. It is nice if you have already installed an SSH client on your laptop and can connect to Adroit via SSH (as outlined in this [guide](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/education/training/hardware-and-software-requirements-picscie-workshops)), but SSH is not a prerequisite.
