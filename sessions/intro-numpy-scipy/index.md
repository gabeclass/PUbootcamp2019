## Description ##
This session will introduce Numpy, the package that underlies most scientific computing done in Python.  More specifically, it will explain the Numpy array, the principal 

## Learning objectives ##
Attendees will come away with the basic skills needed to connect to a research computing cluster, navigate the environment and file system, and run programs through the SLURM scheduler.

## Knowledge prerequisites ##
Basic Linux and the Bash command-line (covered in the earlier "Intro to the Linux Command Line" session)

## Hardware/software prerequisites ##
(1) Bring a laptop which can connect to the eduroam wireless network. You will also need to be able to [Duo](https://princeton.service-now.com/snap?id=kb_article&sys_id=692a27064f9ca20018ddd48e5210c72b) authenticate to use campus resources. (2) Have an [SSH client](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/education/training/hardware-and-software-requirements-picscie-workshops) installed on your laptop. (3) Register for an account on [Adroit](https://forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/). This is the cluster we will use for demonstration purposes. Make sure you can SSH to Adroit before the session by following this [guide](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/education/training/hardware-and-software-requirements-picscie-workshops).
